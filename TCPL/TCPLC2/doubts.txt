Doubts:
Difference between \n and \r and EOF in input. How to differentiate? Is while((c = getchar()) != '\n') 
then s[i] = '\0' same as scanf. scanf("%s\n", s) in demo is something different.
Code:
#include <stdio.h>

void main()
{
    char s[50];
    scanf("%s\n", s);
    printf("%i", s[5]);
}
